# TouchscreenDOE
R code for analysis of 2018 Touchscreen DOE data

This repository is home to the analysis code for Binghamton University's Infant and Child Studies Project's study on the
differential outcomes effect (DOE) using a touchscreen computer. Participants are college students and the main purpose
of this experiment is to investigate perseveration issues encountered on a gaze contingent, eye-tracking version of this
experiment. We will soon run children (ages 4-6 years) on the touchscreen version.
