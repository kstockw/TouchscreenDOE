R code for analysis of 2018/2019 Touchscreen DOE data

This repository is home to the analysis code for Binghamton University's Infant and Child Studies Project's study on the
differential outcomes effect (DOE) using a touchscreen computer. Participants are college students and children (4-6 yrs) and the main purpose of this experiment is to investigate perseveration issues encountered on a gaze contingent, eye-tracking version of this experiment. We are currently analyzing pilot child data.
