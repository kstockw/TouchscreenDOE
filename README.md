# TouchscreenDOE
R code for analysis of 2018/2019 Touchscreen DOE data

This repository is home to the analysis code for Binghamton University's Infant and Child Studies Project's study on the
differential outcomes effect (DOE) using a touchscreen computer. Participants are college students and children (4-6 yrs) and the main purpose of this experiment is to investigate perseveration issues encountered on a gaze contingent, eye-tracking version of this experiment.

TDOE_Prompt is used to analyze adult data.
TDOE_Kids is used to analyze child data. This is the more updated file (6/2019) and may contain more efficient methods of data tidying (removing rows/participants, filtering columns, etc).
Extra_Scripts contains a function (moveme) developed by a StackOverflow user that is used in the TDOE_Kids script.
